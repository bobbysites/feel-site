Put simply, start new conversations. Pick up the phone, reach out on email, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.feel-digital.co.uk\/b2b-linkedin-marketing\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"91\">send a LinkedIn connection<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Why user generated content will help you get your foot in the door<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The impact of using user generated content to not only retain, but also gain viewership, is extremely beneficial for businesses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After streaming one of ITV\u2019s most popular TV shows Ant and Dec\u2019s Saturday Night Takeaway, without a live audience last week, ITV saw viewing figures of 11 million people tuning in, resulting in this being their highest viewing numbers since the show began over 15 years ago.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"650\" height=\"350\" src=\"https:\/\/www.feel-digital.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/ant-and-dec.png\" alt=\"ant-and-dec no audience\" class=\"wp-image-972\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.feel-digital.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/ant-and-dec.png 650w, https:\/\/www.feel-digital.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/ant-and-dec-300x162.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Ant and Dec requested their fans to send in videos of them dancing to fill the fact there was no studio audience. This saw a huge response with households up and down the country sending videos of themselves all in the hope to be broadcasted live on the Saturday night.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, by showing you can amend your usual way of business to fit these exceptional circumstances, it shows determination and fidelity to your customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>How can you adapt your marketing strategy online?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though we\u2019ve been aware of it for much longer, it\u2019s now been a full month since the COVID-19 turned our lives upside down!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it\u2019s social distancing, not being able to see loved ones, getting to grips with a limited life outdoors or literally removing all the skin on your hands from washing them a few hundred times per day. The Coronavirus is something most of us never expected to affect our way of life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And due to the sizeable impact on the economy, businesses need to adapt. Here are some tips on how you can revise your online marketing strategy to help make the most of the situation:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Help other unselfishly<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Like everyone else, Feel hasn\u2019t been immune to the current climate. We\u2019ve lost clients, but we still decided to provide as much advice and information as possible to local businesses and anyone who needs help. It doesn\u2019t matter if this doesn\u2019t lead to any future business, we just want to be able to look back say <span>\u201cwe did what we could to help\u201d<\/span>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Show that you care.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Cheaper paid ads<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019ve ever thought about starting a paid ads campaign, now may be the best time as we\u2019re seeing a trend that most paid ads are becoming cheaper. When you think about it, it does make sense. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.feel-digital.co.uk\/paid-search\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"170\">Paid search like Google Ads<\/a> need small businesses to drive up the cost per click so bigger companies have to spend more. However, if there\u2019s not as many small businesses, there\u2019s not as much competition!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Educational based training is a winner!<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Joe Wicks, ever heard of him? He had a million people live stream his PE classes. Admittedly he already had a good platform, but he turned his subsequently cancelled tour of schools promoting fitness and healthy living into being the nation\u2019s PE teacher during lockdown. What could you do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-1 wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"714\" height=\"487\" src=\"https:\/\/www.feel-digital.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/joewicks.jpg\" alt=\"joe wicks PE\" class=\"wp-image-1012\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.feel-digital.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/joewicks.jpg 714w, https:\/\/www.feel-digital.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/joewicks-300x205.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 714px) 100vw, 714px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What about a payment plan?<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies have seen a 12% average <a href=\"https:\/\/www.feel-digital.co.uk\/cro\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"184\">increase on conversions<\/a> when offering a consumer an option to pay for their purchase with instalments.
